        "context": "Information chunk 1:\nChallenge Sierra Mountain Express was an early ELD adopter who had used Rand McNally for years. When Rand McNally required a hardware change, SME decided to see what today s ELD market had to offer. The company evaluated five ELDs with the goal of finding a modern, easy-to-use solution at a fair price. Motive was the clear winner for its simplicity. Not only is Motive user friendly, but the support is second to none. Erick Stallings, Safety Manager for Sierra Mountain Express Solution Safety Manager Eric Stallings says had used Motive at a previous company many years ago. He loved the simplicity.\nTITLE: Steel View\n\nInformation chunk 2:\nMETADATA: \ncategories: \ntags: \nEXCERPT: Discover what s new in Motive s all-in-one solution.

Each new feature Motive has added is simple and built with the user in mind. This gives us tremendous confidence about the future of this platform and the execution of the product roadmap the company presented at our last Customer Advisory Board meeting, says Stallings. Results The drivers loved making the switch to Motive. Stallings says, Our drivers that were on Rand McNally prefer Motive hands down. Those who had never used an ELD were surprised at how easy it was, even those who are older and not as tech-savvy. Motive s intuitive technology has also streamlined SME s back-office operations. Our back office staff likes Motive 100 better, explains Stallings. With Rand McNally, we had to go through a long drop down and complex series of clicks just to see a driver s logs. With Motive, you click a button, and there they are.\nTITLE: Steel View\n\n",
